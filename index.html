      <p1 style="float: light; color:white">My name is Samantha Sedjunggo and I am currently a student (3942916) at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). My ethnicity is Chinese Indonesian and I can speak Indonesian, Japanese and English. I graduated high school from Our Lady of Mercy College from 2016-2021 and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I have a passion for music as I have been playing piano since the age of 3 due to my strict stereotypical asian parents. This love for music has also grown towards a love for film as I fell in love with their scores and soundtracks and then it grew to an overall love for the experience that films create.</p1>

  </header>
<body>
  <p2
    style = "color: white">During my final years of high school, I was really stumped on what field I wanted to pursue. All my life I felt as if I was mediocre at everything so I decided to explore all different areas from medicine to marketing but none seemed to fit. It wasn't until my father started discussing his previous passion of information technology (I.T) that made me look into the field and the vast sub categories it offers officially. Hearing him explain his interest in programming and technological advancements in depth was really enlightening but also disheartening as he was not fortunate enough to take this passion to tertiary studies due to his lack of finance as a young immigrant from Indonesia. This is when I started to consider I.T seriously and began my own research. <p2>
    <br>
    <br>
  <p3>After discussing with my father, I decided to conduct further research in the best way I knew how, by watching films. With my love for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, I started with 2016 'Snowden'. The film depicts the real-life events of Edward Snowden, a former computer intelligence consultant who leaked exceptionally classified information from the National Security Agency in the United States of America. This film sparked my interest in cyber security as I was inspired by Snowden’s determination to safeguard the American population’s security and privacy by revealing this classified information. Besides watching and learning about the I.T space through films and general YouTube videos, I don’t have much personal experience in I.T. </p3>
    <br>
    <br>
  <p4> I expected to learn about a vast board subcategory of I.T and finalise which area of I.T I would like to pursue as a career. As I’m not that well versed in the entirety of the I.T world, so I expect to learn more in depth details during my studies.<p4>
    <br>
    <br>
  <p5>I decided to choose Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) for multiple reasons; detailed technology course, location and the university’s atmosphere. I first looked into I.T at RMIT for its name sake but after doing my own research I was intrigued by the university's many minor’s it had to offer in the course. I was mostly intrigued by cyber security. RMIT’s I.T course being held in the city also made the university more alluring as it was only a ten minute walk and a simple train ride from home, easy travel. Although I was unfortunate to experience an open day due to COVID-19, fortunately, I have an older sister who attended RMIT and described the university’s atmosphere as a whole. After experiencing other universities on high school excursions, the atmosphere felt very stressful and unmeaningful. I was attracted to RMIT’s sense of community and overall approachable aura described from both my sister and YouTube videos of RMIT students.<p5>

<p style = "margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px"> The position of <a href="https://jobs.disneycareers.com/job/-/-/391/24843297968?codes=INDEED">'Lighting Supervisor'</a> at Industrial Light & Magic details how the employee should generate lighting manipulations using software platforms to execute the creative vision of said project. The responsibilities of ‘Lighting Supervisor’ is to lead a team of other Lighting technicians and to supervise the quality so it is up to the standard required. This position appeals to me because working under a major film company has always been a dream of mine, to create and be a part of the process of the films that I loved as a child would be a very fulfilling career.</p>
  <p>The skills needed for this position is to understand software systems used such as; Katana, Maya and other CG composition software alongside program language Python and operating system Linux. Aside from technical skills, this position also requires various soft skills like communication, leadership and presenting abilities. These soft skills are just as important as the technical skills as this position details leadership among other coworkers is vital as a supervisor. As I completed VCE Media I do have an understanding of film jargon which would help me in this field. That alongside my tertiary education studying a Bachelor of Information Technology, I will be able to understand the programming language Python. These more technical skills are vital for the ‘Lighting Supervisor’ position. In terms of soft skills, I have worked with different teams, therefore different types of people, for both work and group assignments and always use communication as the key to success for everything to run smoothly and effectively. I am currently assistant manager at a hospitality job, which is useful for the ‘Lighting Supervisor’ role as I am familiar with leading newer coworkers and providing results for managers and higher ups. </p>

  <p>As I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology, in order for me to qualify for the ‘Lighting Supervisor’ position I will most likely have to have previously worked in the film industry through the technology department so I can firstly be exposed to the industry but also gain experience needed to be a supervisor. I would also potentially need to further my tertiary studies by completing a diploma or a Master of Science specialising in Computer science to further my understanding on software systems, heuristic optimisation and data analytics that could possibly assist in this position. </p>

  <br>
  <p>My Myer-Briggs test showcases that I am a Turbulent Protagonist (ENFJ-T), my learning style is tactic and openness and extraversion are my top two in the Big Five Personality test. These results reflect the person I am and in turn the way I behave, work and perceived in public. After reading about ENFJ-T, I believe this does accurately describe who I am which is; extroverted, intuitive, feeling and judging. ‘16 Personalities’ website describes that ENFJ-T take on a diplomatic role which they focus on connecting and helping others - “cooperating rather than competing”. This also sums up my personality as I am very willing and wanting to work in a team if we can all cooperate together.</p>

  <p>My personality is also reflected on the ‘Big Five Personality’ test results as it suggests that openness and extraversion are my top ones. Openness details that I “think in abstract, complex ways,” and extraversion “engage actively with others to earn friendship, admiration, power [and] status ” This alongside the Myer-Briggs test results indicate that I tend to act as a leader which might be an issue when forming a team if I unofficially advocate myself as the leader if I take charge of the work. </p>
  <p>Something that shocked me was the learning style test where the results showed that I was more of a “hands on” learner, tactile style, in comparison to a visual or auditory. Although the percentiles of each type of learning styles are similar, discovering that tactile was first shocked me because I always thought my love for music and film would allude to visual or auditory topping rather than tactile. Despite this, being a tactile learner will probably be more favourable when working in a team because it encourages interactions between group members. I learn the best through open discussions, communication and physically doing things which can make for more exchanges between team members. </p>

style="color:#c2c2a3; text-align: center">Project Ideas</h2>
  <p>‘Cinema Core’ is a streaming service platform targeted towards immunocompromised patients in hospitals across Australia to be able to rent the latest cinematic featured films at their own comfort without risking their health. Similar to <a href="https://www.medicinema.org.uk/">'MediCinema'</a> in the UK and the <a href="https://specialtycinema.com/royal-childrens-hospital-melbourne-cinema/"> 'Hoyts Corporation in the Royal Children’s Hospital'</a>, however, both of these cases have installed cinemas directly into the respective hospitals. Cinema Core’s main objective is to be a streaming service platform, easily accessible through an app and website to showcase the latest films for patients in Australia on their own technological devices. </p>
  <p>According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in the year 2019 to 2020 (inclusive), there were an estimated “11.1 million hospitalisations for admitted patients” across public and private hospitals in Australia. This statistic however is a decrease by “2.8%” from previous years, however, prior year-to-year changes indicated “a consistent upward trend”. This could be due to the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions  in 2020 impacting the hospital system. Cinema Core would have been useful to those eleven million patients who were situated in hospitals for an extensive amount of time as film can be used as an escape and normality from the difficulties that their conditions bring. </p>
  <p>Similar to other streaming service applications such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, Cinema Core will provide users the opportunity to watch films through both a mobile app or an online website. However unlike current streaming services, Cinema core mainly provides the latest cinematic feature films for rent to the target audience who are hospital patients who are restricted from leaving the grounds due to immunocompromised conditions. By teaming up with Australian film exhibition brands such as Village Cinemas or the Hoyts Corporation, Cinema Core would be an extension to these services to specifically target and help patients. Cinema Core will work with different hospitals across Australia to recognise patients thus allowing them to join and freely enjoy the benefits the service has.</p>
  <p>As Cinema Core’s partnering with an Australian cinema company, alongside the blockbuster films, Cinema Core will also hold special reshowings of old films during similar times as the cinema companies reshowcase them. Users are allowed to rent these films as well as the latest blockbuster films. These reshowings will allow for a broder film range for patients to use similarly to other streaming services. However, the main attraction of Cinema Core is showcasing the latest blockbuster films in comfort without risking users' health. </p>
  <p>Cinema Core will work with hospitals across Australia to verify users' identities to join the service. This is done with the users privacy in mind as every patient has the right to privatise their own medical health to be kept secure and confidential. This is why Cinema Core will work closely with hospitals to ensure this privacy is upheld but also that the service is going towards the right people in need. </p>
  <p>Something to look out for are those patients who are still considered immunocompromised but are not situated in a hospital due to different circumstances. These patients also suffer with discomfort and being restricted to their household also cuts them off from a life outside, similar to the patients in the hospital. As Cinema Core is designed for patients, it is important to also recognise those who are not admitted long term into hospitals. By doing so, Cinema Core should have a feature where patients can apply to sign up to Cinema Core and the patients’ most frequent hospital can confirm their status which allows for them to also join Cinema Core. </p>
  <p>A potential drawback of this is the renting price of the films. A goal would be to have the same prices as theatres do as Cinema Core would be partnering with an Australian cinema company, however, realistically the distribution companies who negotiate with theatres might raise the price due to more revenue being made through a streaming service website and in turn increase prices to rent the films online in comparison to in person tickets as renting would have a longer time frame to watch the film than physical viewings. Renting can also lead to an increase of pirating the latest blockbuster films illegally thus creating a problem in the film industry. </p>
  <p>To create the website multiple systems would be used such as Apache to give the users the relevant information they wanted through files. This will be stored on servers all around Australia to keep up and running. As Cinema Core will work with hospitals to grant patients to sign up to Cinema Core, there will have to be a database to hold this information from patient names, hospital name, hospital location, billing information, rented films, etc. This can be stored in databases such as DynamoDB, NoSQL, Oracle to manage this information. </p>
  <p>As Cinema Core will be available on both an app and a website, developing these is a skill that is required. A Progressive Web App (PWA) could be used to develop both as it is a hybrid of a “regular web page” and “mobile app”. In doing so, freelance developer skills would have to be hired in order to create and develop Cinema Core’s app and website. This can be done using programming languages such as Objective-C and Swift for IOS apps or Java and Kotlin for Android apps. Hiring a specialist would be the most beneficial to ensure everything runs smoothly and successfully.</p>
  <p>If Cinema Core is successful, this will hopefully give much needed entertainment to the millions of hospitalised patients who are suffering due to their respective conditions. Through Cinema Core, patients can have some normality as they are able to watch the latest films much like the rest of the population and also provide escapism in their lives to hopefully allow enjoyment as they are going through a difficult time. The impact overtime will be hope and optimism for patients as they are able to get their minds distracted and also encourage interactions between others such as fellow patients or friends.</p>
